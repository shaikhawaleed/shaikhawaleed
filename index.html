</div>
<hr />
<p>When the pandameic started, I enrolled in a couple of virtual courses on <b>fashion, materials, and trends</b>. This was the point at which I considered starting my own business.</p>
<p>I started studying fabrics and materials in greater depth. I did a lot of research and visited a lot of stores in Bahrain to see what the differences were, what was better, and what the prices were.
It quickly became <b>my primary passion</b>, and whenever I had free time, I would either research and read about it or visit stores to view the materials in person.</p>
