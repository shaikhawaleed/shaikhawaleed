<h1> My Journey </h1>
</div>
<hr />
<p> I began my career in fashion a year ago, when Covid quarantined us and left us with nothing to do, I decided to take advantage of the situation and start my own small <b>business</b> I began <b>creating</b> my own designs, <b>purchasing</b> fabric, and <b>looking</b> for the ideal tailor.</p>

<p> I didn't think I'd succeed at first, since my style isn't typical; I prefer to stand out. I also didn't think others would enjoy the designs because our community has a distinct style and rarely deviates from it.</p>
<p> <b>Surprisingly</b>, people actually loved my designs, and I attracted customers, despite the fact that my sales weren't always high, but I felt it was great at first.</p>

<h1> My First Piece </h1>
</div>
<img src="C:\Users\Waleed\Desktop\picturs\53557.jpg"width="300" height="400"/>
<p> This was the first piece i designed & sold. I didn’t think people from Bahrain would buy it as its a bright color and they would prefer something darker. But it actually was my best seller dress for 2 months straight.

In the first picture you could see the photo quality wasn’t clear and professional, the background isn’t really suitable for a business. And you can see the dress was a bit wrinkled.</p>
<p> As a <b>beginner</b> i didn’t think these little details would matter, I thought all that mattered was the <b>quality</b> of the dress, <b>fabric</b> and <b>design</b>, but it turns out that these little details were all that mattered.

I went through alot <b>ups & downs</b>. Many dresses I designed didn’t come as expected. I didn’t know whats the perfect profit for me, as my main focus was on the product itself.</p>
